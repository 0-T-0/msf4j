# WSO2 Microservices Framework for Java (MSF4J) Product Distribution

This distribution contains all the relevant runtime as well as development time libraries to build microservices using
WSO2 MSF4J.

It includes 5 samples which demonstrate all the core capabilities in MSF4J.

We have excluded the pet store sample from this distribution since it would increase the size of the distro.
Inspired by the popular JavaEE pet store sample, the MSF4J pet store
sample is a comprehensive sample which demonstrates how to build a microservices solution and demonstrates some key
aspects & concepts of Microservices Architecture (MSA) and demonstrates certain aspects of microservices
*inner architecture* as well as *outer architecture*.
