# Serve Files with WSO2 MSS

You can serve files from the resource methods by returning a java.io.File or 
by returning a javax.ws.rs.core.Response object with a java.io.File entity.
See the following sample.

```java
    @GET
    @Path("/{fileName}")
    public Response getFile(@PathParam("fileName") String fileName) {
        File file = Paths.get(MOUNT_PATH, fileName).toFile();
        if (file.exists()) {
            return Response.ok(file).build();
        }
        return Response.status(Response.Status.NOT_FOUND).build();
    }
```
